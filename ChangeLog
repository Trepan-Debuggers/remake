Sun Jul 28 15:37:09 1996  Rob Tulloh (tulloh@tivoli.com)

	* w32/pathstuff.c: Turned convert_vpath_to_win32() into a
	real function. This was done so that VPATH could contain
	white space separated pathnames. Please note that directory
	paths (in VPATH/vpath context) containing white space are not
	supported (just as they are not under Unix). See README.WIN32
	for suggestions.

	* w32/include/pathstuff.h: Added prototype for the new
	function convert_vpath_to_win32. Deleted macro for same.

	* README.WIN32: Added some notes about why I chose not to try
	and support pathnames which contain white space and some
	workaround suggestions.

Wed May 15 10:14:14 CDT 1996  Rob Tulloh  <tulloh@tivoli.com>

	* dir.c: WIN32 does not support inode. For now, fully qualified
	pathname along with st_mtime will be keys for files.
	Fixed problem where vpath can be confused when files
	are added to a directory after the directory has already been
	read in. The code now attempts to reread the directory if it
	discovers that the datestamp on the directory has changed since
	it was cached by make. This problem only seems to occur on WIN32
	right now so it is lumped under port #ifdef WIN32.

	* function.c: WIN32: call subproc library (CreateProcess()) instead of
	fork/exec.

	* job.c: WIN32: Added the code to do fork/exec/waitpid style processing
	on WIN32 systems via calls to subproc library.

	* main.c: WIN32: Several things added here. First, there is code
	for dealing with PATH and SHELL defaults. Make tries to figure
	out if the user has %PATH% set in the environment and sets it to
	%Path% if it is not set already. Make also looks to see if sh.exe
	is anywhere to be found. Code path through job.c will change
	based on existence of a working Bourne shell. The checking for
	default shell is done twice: once before makefiles are read in
	and again after. Fall back to MSDOS style execution mode if no sh.exe
	is found. Also added some debug support that allows user to pause make
	with -D switch and attach a debugger. This is especially useful for
	debugging recursive calls to make where problems appear only in the
	sub-make.

	* make.h: WIN32: A few macros and header files for WIN32 support.

	* misc.c: WIN32: Added a function end_of_token_w32() to assist
	in parsing code in read.c.

	* read.c: WIN32: Fixes similar to MSDOS which allow colon to
	appear in filenames. Use of colon in filenames would otherwise
	confuse make.

	* remake.c: WIN32: Added include of io.h to eliminate compiler
	warnings. Added some code to default LIBDIR if it is not set
	on WIN32.

	* variable.c: WIN32: Added support for detecting Path/PATH
	and converting them to semicolon separated lists for make's
	internal use. New function sync_Path_environment()
	which is called in job.c and function.c before creating a new
	process. Caller must set Path in environment since we don't
	have fork() to do this for us.

	* vpath.c: WIN32: Added detection for filenames containing
	forward or backward slashes.

	* NMakefile: WIN32: Visual C compatible makefile for use with nmake.
	Use this to build GNU make the first time on Windows NT or Windows 95.

	* README.WIN32: WIN32: Contains some helpful notes.

	* build_w32.bat: WIN32: If you don't like nmake, use this the first
	time you build GNU make on Windows NT or Windows 95.

	* config.h.WIN32: WIN32 version of config.h

	* subproc.bat: WIN32: A bat file used to build the
	subproc library from the top-level NMakefile. Needed because
	WIndows 95 (nmake) doesn't allow you to cd in a make rule.

	* w32/include/dirent.h
	* w32/compat/dirent.c: WIN32: opendir, readdir, closedir, etc.

	* w32/include/pathstuff.h: WIN32: used by files needed functions
	defined in pathstuff.c (prototypes).

	* w32/include/sub_proc.h: WIN32: prototypes for subproc.lib functions.

	* w32/include/w32err.h: WIN32: prototypes for w32err.c.

	* w32/pathstuff.c: WIN32: File and Path/Path conversion functions.

	* w32/subproc/build.bat: WIN32: build script for subproc library
	if you don't wish to use nmake.

	* w32/subproc/NMakefile: WIN32: Visual C compatible makefile for use
	with nmake. Used to build subproc library.

	* w32/subproc/misc.c: WIN32: subproc library support code
	* w32/subproc/proc.h: WIN32: subproc library support code
	* w32/subproc/sub_proc.c: WIN32: subproc library source code
	* w32/subproc/w32err.c: WIN32: subproc library support code

Mon May 13 14:37:42 1996  Roland McGrath  <roland@delasyd.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Version 3.74.4.

	* GNUmakefile (vmsfiles): Fix typo.

	* GNUmakefile (amigafiles): Add amiga.h.

Sun May 12 19:19:43 1996  Aaron Digulla   <digulla@fh-konstanz.de>

	* dir.c: New function: amigafy() to fold filenames
	Changes HASH() to HASHI() to fold filenames on Amiga.
	Stringcompares use strieq() instead of streq()
	The current directory on Amiga is "" instead of "."
	* file.c: Likewise.

	* amiga.c: New function wildcard_expansion(). Allows to use
	Amiga wildcards with $(wildcard )

	* amiga.h: New file. Prototypes for amiga.c

	* function.c: Use special function wildcard_expansion() for
	$(wildcard ) to allow Amiga wildcards
	The current directory on Amiga is "" instead of "."

	* job.c: No Pipes on Amiga, too
	(load_too_high) Neither on Amiga
	ENV variable on Amiga are in a special directory and are not
	passed as third argument to main().

	* job.h: No envp on Amiga

	* make.h: Added HASHI(). This is the same as HASH() but converts
	it's second parameter to lowercase on Amiga to fold filenames.

	* main.c: (main), variable.c Changed handling of ENV-vars. Make
	stores now the names of the variables only and reads their contents
	when they are accessed to reflect that these variables are really
	global (ie. they CAN change WHILE make runs !) This handling is
	made in lookup_variable()

	* Makefile.ami: renamed file.h to filedep.h
	Updated dependencies

	* read.c: "find_semicolon" is declared as static but never defined.
	No difference between Makefile and makefile on Amiga; added
	SMakefile to *default_makefiles[].
	(read_makefile) SAS/C want's two_colon and pattern_percent be set
	before use.
	The current directory on Amiga is "" instead of "."
	Strange #endif moved.

	* README.Amiga: updated feature list

	* SMakefile: Updated dependencies

	* variable.c: Handling of ENV variable happens inside lookup_variable()

Sat May 11 17:58:32 1996  Roland McGrath  <roland@delasyd.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* variable.c (try_variable_definition): Count parens in lhs variable
	refs to avoid seeing =/:=/+= inside a ref.

Thu May  9 13:54:49 1996  Roland McGrath  <roland@delasyd.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* commands.c (fatal_error_signal) [SIGQUIT]: Make SIGQUIT check
	conditional.

	* main.c (main): Use unsigned for fread return.

	* read.c (parse_file_seq): Use `int' for char arg to avoid widening
	conflict issues.
	* dep.h: Fix prototype.

	* function.c (expand_function) [_AMIGA]: Fix some typos.
	(patsubst_expand): Make len vars unsigned.

	* GNUmakefile (globfiles): Add AmigaDOS support files.
	(distfiles): Add $(amigafiles).
	(amigafiles): New variable.

Thu Nov  7 10:18:16 1995  Aaron Digulla   <digulla@fh-konstanz.de>

	* Added Amiga support in commands.c, dir.c, function.c,
	job.c, main.c, make.h, read.c, remake.c
	* commands.c: Amiga has neither SIGHUP nor SIGQUIT
	* dir.c: Amiga has filenames with Upper- and Lowercase,
	but "FileName" is the same as "filename". Added strieq()
	which is use to compare filenames. This is like streq()
	on all other systems. Also there is no such thing as
	"." under AmigaDOS.
	* function.c: On Amiga, the environment is not passed as envp,
	there are no pipes and Amiga can't fork. Use my own function
	to create a new child.
	* job.c: default_shell is "" (The system automatically chooses
	a shell for me). Have to use the same workaround as MSDOS for
	running batch commands. Added HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H. NOFILE isn't
	known on Amiga. Cloned code to run children from MSDOS. Own
	version of sh_chars[] and sh_cmds[]. No dup2() or dup() on Amiga.
	* main.c: Force stack to 20000 bytes. Read environment from ENV:
	device. On Amiga, exec_command() does return, so I exit()
	afterwards.
	* make.h: Added strieq() to compare filenames.
	* read.c: Amiga needs special extension to have passwd. Only
	one include-dir. "Makefile" and "makefile" are the same.
	Added "SMakefile".  Added special code to handle device names (xxx:)
	and "./" in rules.
	* remake.c: Only one lib-dir. Amiga link-libs are named "%s.lib"
	instead of "lib%s.a".
	* main.c, rule.c, variable.c: Avoid floats at all costs.
	* vpath.c: Get rid of as many alloca()s as possible.

	variable definition and (if !ENV) enter goal targets here.
	(decode_env_switches): Use allocated_variable_expand to store value.
	Use find_next_token to simplify word-splitting loop.  Don't
	prepend a dash to uninterpreted value.  Instead, if split into

	* arscan.c (ar_scan): New local var NAMEMAP.
	In loop, rename NAME to NAMEBUF; new var NAME is a pointer; new

	like " /N", get full name from NAMEMAP+N.

	the elt's data into alloca'd NAMEMAP.
	(ar_name_equal): #if 0 truncating code.

	* make.h: Don't declare vfork at all.  It returns int anyway,
	unless <unistd.h> declared it; and we conflicted with some systems.

	* main.c (define_makeflags): If FLAGSTRING[1] is '-', define
	MAKEFLAGS to all of FLAGSTRING, not &FLAGSTRING[1].  Don't want to
	define it to something like "-no-print-directory".

	else to "get".
	* default.c (default_variables): Set GET to macro SCCS_GET.

	* read.c (parse_file_seq): Take extra arg STRIP; strip `./' only
	if nonzero.  I hope this is the last time this argument is added
	or removed.

	* main.c (switches: --no-print-directory): Use 1 instead of -1 for
	single-letter option.
	(init_switches, decode_switches, define_makeflags): An option with
	no single-letter version is no longer indicated by a value of -1;
	instead a value that is !isalnum.
	(init_switches): Don't put such switches into the string, only
	into the long_option table.

	* make.h [!NSIG] [!_NSIG]: #define NSIG 32.

	* job.c [HAVE_WAITPID]: Remove #undef HAVE_UNION_WAIT.  AIX's
	bsdcc defined WIF* to use union wait.

	* main.c (struct command_switch): Change member `c' to type int.
	(switches): Make const.
	(decode_switches): Use `const struct command_switch *'.
	(define_makeflags): Likewise.

	[HAVE_MEMORY_H]: Test this instead of NEED_MEMORY_H.

	[sparc]: Don't test this for alloca.h; HAVE_ALLOCA_H is sufficient.
	[HAVE_SIGSETMASK]: Test this rather than USG.
	[__GNU_LIBRARY__ || POSIX]: Don't #include <unistd.h> again.
	* main.c (main): Handle SIGCHLD if defined, and SIGCLD if defined.
	It doesn't hurt to do both if they are both defined, and testing
	USG is useless.
	* dir.c: Rationalize directory header conditionals.
	* arscan.c [HAVE_FCNTL_H]: Test this rather than USG || POSIX.

	* default.c (default_suffixes): Add `.txinfo'.
	(default_suffix_rules): Add `.txinfo.info' and `.txinfo.dvi' rules.

	* variable.c (try_variable_definition): Replace RECURSIVE flag
	with enum FLAVOR, which can be simple, recursive, or append.
	Recognize += as append flavor.  Set new variable VALUE in a switch
	on FLAVOR.  For append flavor, prepend the variable's old value.
	If the variable was previously defined recursive, set FLAVOR to
	recursive; if it was defined simple, expand the new value before
	appending it to the old value.  Pass RECURSIVE flag to
	define_variable iff FLAVOR == recursive.

	* variable.c (try_variable_definition): Use alloca and bcopy for
	NAME, instead of savestring.  Might as well use stack storage
	since we free it immediately anyway.

	* job.c (start_waiting_jobs): Move decl of JOB outside of loop.

	(start_waiting_job): Changed return type from void to int.
	Return 0 when putting the child on the waiting_jobs chain.
	(start_waiting_jobs): Don't check load and job_slots here.
	Always take a job off the chain and call start_waiting_job on it;
	give up and return when start_waiting_job returns zero.

	* main.c (define_makeflags: struct flag): Change member `char c' to
	`struct command_switch *switch'.
	(ADD_FLAG): Set that to CS instead of CS->c.
	If CS->c is -1, increment FLAGSLEN for the long name.
	When writing out FLAGS, handle FLAGS->switch->c == -1 and write
	the long name instead.

	* compatMakefile (stamp-config): New target of old config.h rule.
	Touch stamp-config after running config.status.
	(config.h): Just depend on stamp-config, and have empty commands.

Mon Apr  5 20:14:02 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* job.c [HAVE_WAITPID]: #undef HAVE_UNION_WAIT.

Fri Apr  2 17:15:46 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* main.c (long_option_aliases): Remove "new"; it is already an
	unambiguous prefix of "new-file".

	* remake.c [eta10]: Include <fcntl.h> instead of <sys/file.h>.

	(print_rule_data_base): Don't record info on `subdir' flags.

	* implicit.c (pattern_search): Check the DEP->changed flag rather
	than the (now gone) RULE->subdir flag.  Also test CHECK_LASTSLASH;
	if it is set, the file might exist even though the DEP->changed
	flag is set.

	* rule.c (count_implicit_rule_limits): Pass "", not ".", as file
	name arg to dir_file_exists_p to check for existence of directory.

	* implicit.c (pattern_search): Inside dep-finding loop, set
	CHECK_LASTSLASH from the value recorded in CHECKED_LASTSLASH[I],
	rather than computing it anew.

	* commands.c (set_file_variables): Must alloca space for PERCENT
	and copy it, to avoid leaving the trailing `)' in the value.

	* misc.c (remove_comments): Fixed backslash-checking loop
	condition to allow it to look at the first char on the line.
	P2 >= LINE, not P2 > LINE.

	* compatMakefile ($(bindir)/$(instname)): Before moving $@.new to
	$@, rm $@.old and mv $@ to $@.old.

	* variable.c (try_variable_definition): Take new args FILENAME and
	LINENO.  Fatal if the variable name is empty.
	* read.c (read_makefile): Change callers.
	* main.c (main): Likewise.

	* compatMakefile (group): Define to @KMEM_GROUP@, autoconf magic
	that configure will replace with the group owning /dev/kmem.

Mon Feb  8 14:26:43 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* vpath.c (vpath_search): Take second arg MTIME_PTR, pass thru to
	selective_vpath_search.
	(selective_vpath_search): Take second arg MTIME_PTR.
	If the dir cache thinks a file exists, stat it to make sure, and
	put the modtime in *MTIME_PTR.
	* remake.c (library_search): Take second arg MTIME_PTR.
	When we find a match, record its mtime there.
	Pass MTIME_PTR through to vpath_search to do same.
	(f_mtime): Pass &MTIME as new 2nd arg to {vpath,library}_search;
	store it in FILE->last_mtime if set nonzero.
	* implicit.c (pattern_search): Pass nil 2nd arg to vpath_search.

	* compatMakefile (remote.o): Prepend `$(srcdir)/' to `remote-*.c',
	so globbing looks somewhere it will find things.

	* compatMakefile ($(infodir)/$(instname).info): Install `make.info*'
	not `$(srcdir)/make.info*'; no need to use basename.

Fri Feb  5 12:52:43 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.63.3.

	* compatMakefile (install): Add missing ;\s.

	Make -, @, and + prefixes on a pre-expanded command line affect
	all lines in the expansion, not just the first.
	* commands.h (struct commands): Replace `lines_recurse' member
	with `lines_flags'.
	(COMMANDS_{RECURSE,SILENT,NOERROR}): New macros, bits to set in
	that flag byte.
	* commands.c (chop_commands): Set `lines_flags' instead of
	`lines_recurse'.  Record not only + but also @ and - prefixes.
	* remake.c (notice_finished_file): Check the COMMANDS_RECURSE bit
	in FILE->cmds->lines_flags, rather than FILE->cmds->lines_recurse.
	* job.c (start_job_command): Replaced RECURSIVE and NOPRINT local
	var with FLAGS; initialize it to the appropriate `lines_flags' byte.
	Set CHILD->noerror if the COMMANDS_NOERROR bit is set in FLAGS.
	Set the COMMANDS_SILENT bit in FLAGS for a @ prefix.

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): Set G->file to its prev after
	checking for G being finished, since that check needs to examine
	G->file.

	* configure.in (union wait check) [HAVE_WAITPID]: Try using
	waitpid with a `union wait' STATUS arg.  If waitpid and union wait
	don't work together, we should not use union wait.

	* Version 3.63.2.

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): When G->file->updated, move
	G->file to its prev.  We aren't finished until G->file is nil.

Thu Feb  4 12:53:04 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* main.c (starting_directory): New global variable.
	(main): Set it to cwd after doing -Cs.
	(log_working_directory): Use it, rather than computing each time.
	* make.h: Declare it.

	* compatMakefile (SHELL): Define to /bin/sh for losing Unix makes.

	* main.c (decode_env_switches): Allocate (1 + LEN + 1) words for
	ARGV, rather than LEN words plus one byte.

Wed Feb  3 18:13:52 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* compatMakefile ($(bindir)/$(instname)): Put - before
	install_setgid command line, so its failure won't be an error.
	(infodir): New variable.
	(install): Depend on $(infodir)/$(instname).info.
	($(infodir)/$(instname).info): New target.

	* read.c (read_makefile): If FILENAMES is nil when we see a line
	starting with a tab, don't treat it as a command.  Just fall
	through, rather than giving an error.

	* read.c (read_makefile): If the NO_TARGETS flag is set when we see a
	command line, don't clear it before continuing.  We want
	subsequent command lines to be ignored as well.

	* job.c (new_job): Before expanding each command line, collapse
	backslash-newline combinations that are inside var or fn references.

Mon Feb  1 16:00:13 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* compatMakefile (exec_prefix): Default to $(prefix), not /usr/local.

	* job.h [POSIX] (unblock_sigs): Declare.

Sun Jan 31 19:11:05 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* read.c (read_makefile): In vpath parsing, after finding the
	pattern token, take entire rest of line as the search path, not
	just the next token.

	* compatMakefile (remote.o): Depend on remote-*.c.

Thu Jan 28 16:40:29 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* commands.c (set_file_variables): Don't define any F or D versions.
	* variable.c (define_automatic_variables): Define them here as
	recursively-expanded variables that use the dir and notdir funcs.

	* variable.c (target_environment): In v_default case, don't export
	o_default or o_automatic variables.

	* configure.in (union wait check): Remove ` and ' inside C code;
	they confuse the shell script.

Mon Jan 25 13:10:42 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.63.1.

	* vpath.c (construct_vpath_list): When skipping further processing
	of an elt that is ".", don't also skip the code that pushes P past
	the next separator.

	* compatMakefile (distclean): Don't remove make-*.

	* configure.in (HAVE_UNION_WAIT): Try to use WEXITSTATUS if it's
	defined.  If one cannot use WEXITSTATUS with a `union wait'
	argument, we don't want to believe the system has `union wait' at all.

	* remake.c (update_file): Do nothing to print "up to date" msgs.
	(update_goal_chain): Do it here instead.
	Use the `changed' flag of each goal's `struct dep' to keep track
	of whether files_remade (now commands_started) changed around a
	call to update_file for that goal.
	When a goal is finished, and its file's update_status is zero (i.e.,
	success or nothing done), test the `changed' flag and give an "up
	to date" msg iff it is clear.
	* make.h (files_remade): Renamed to commands_started.
	* remake.c: Changed defn.
	(update_goal_chain): Changed uses.
	* job.c (start_job_command): Increment commands_started here.
	(reap_children): Not here.

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): Don't do anything with files'
	`prev' members.  update_file now completely handles this.

	* variable.c (target_environment): Don't expand recursive
	variables if they came from the environment.

	* main.c (define_makeflags): For flags with omitted optional args,
	store {"", 0} with ADD_FLAG.  When constructing FLAGSTRING, a flag
	so stored cannot have more flags appended to the same word.

Fri Jan 22 14:46:16 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* variable.c (print_variable_set): In vars/bucket calculation,
	don't spuriously multiply by 100.

	* Version 3.63.

	* job.c [!HAVE_UNION_WAIT] (WTERMSIG, WCOREDUMP, WEXITSTATUS):
	Don't define if already defined.

	* remake.c (update_file): Don't keep track of the command_state before
	calling update_file_1.  Remove local variable COMMANDS_FINISHED,
	and don't test it to decide to print the "is up to date" msg.
	Testing for files_remade having changed should always be sufficient.
	The old method lost when we are called in the goal chain run on a
	makefile, because the makefile's command_state is already
	`cs_finished' from the makefile chain run.

	* misc.c [HAVE_SETRE[GU]ID]: Test these to decl setre[gu]id.

	* configure.in: Rewrote wait checking.
	Use AC_HAVE_HEADERS to check for <sys/wait.h>.
	Use AC_HAVE_FUNCS to check for waitpid and wait3.
	Use a compile check to test just for `union wait'.
	* job.c: Rewrote conditionals accordingly.
	[HAVE_WAITPID]: Test this only to define WAIT_NOHANG.
	[HAVE_WAIT3]: Likewise.
	[HAVE_UNION_WAIT]: Test this to define WAIT_T and W*.

	* configure.in: Set CFLAGS and LDFLAGS before all checks.

	* dir.c: Add static forward decls of {open,read}_dirstream.

Thu Jan 21 17:18:00 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.62.31.

	* job.c [NGROUPS_MAX && NGROUPS_MAX==0]: #undef NGROUPS_MAX.

	* compatMakefile (CFLAGS, LDFLAGS): Set to @CFLAGS@/@LDFLAGS@.
	* build.template (CFLAGS, LDFLAGS): Same here.
	* configure.in: AC_SUBST(CFLAGS) and LDFLAGS.
	Set them to -g if not defined in the environment.

	* remake.c (library_search): Use LIBNAME consistently, setting it
	only once, to be the passed name sans `-l'.
	Pass new var FILE to be modified by vpath_search.

Mon Jan 18 14:53:54 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.62.30.

	* job.c (start_waiting_jobs): Return when job_slots_used is equal to
	job_slots.

	* configure.in: Add AC_CONST for the sake of getopt.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Continue after parsing `override'
	directive, rather than falling through to lossage.
	Check for EOL or blank after "override define".

	* compatMakefile (.c.o, remote.o): Put $(CFLAGS) after other switches.

Fri Jan 15 12:52:52 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.62.29.

	* main.c (define_makeflags): After writing everything into
	FLAGSTRING, only back up two chars if [-1] is a dash, meaning we
	just wrote " -".  Always terminate the string at *P.

	* remake.c (library_search): When constructing names in std dirs,
	use &(*LIB)[2] for the stem, not LIBNAME (which points at the
	buffer we are writing into!).

Thu Jan 14 13:50:06 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* read.c (read_makefile): Set IN_IGNORED_DEFINE for "override
	define" when IGNORING is true.

	* compatMakefile (distclean): Remove config.status and build.sh.

Wed Jan 13 16:01:12 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* variable.c (define_automatic_variables): Override SHELL value for
	origin o_env_override as well as o_env.

	add the names of the glob objects (w/subdir) to %objs%.
	* build.template (globobjs): Removed.
	Take basename of $objs before linking.

Tue Jan 12 12:31:06 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	(make-$(version).tar.Z): Depend on build.sh.in.

	* main.c (die): Call print_data_base if -p.
	(main): Don't call it here.

	* compatMakefile (defines): Add @DEFS@.  configure should turn this
	into -DHAVE_CONFIG_H.

Mon Jan 11 14:39:23 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.62.26.

	* misc.c (init_access): Surround with #ifdef GETLOADAVG_PRIVILEGED.
	({make,user,child}_access) [! GETLOADAVG_PRIVILEGED]: Make no-op.
	* compatMakefile (install_setgid): New var, set by configure.
	(install): Install setgid $(group) only if $(install_setgid) is true.

Fri Jan  8 15:31:55 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* job.c (load_too_high): If getloadavg fails with errno==0, give a
	message saying that load limits are not supported.

	* vpath.c (construct_vpath_list): Rewrote path deletion code to
	not try to use PATH's next link after freeing PATH.

	* main.c (define_makeflags): Rewritten; now handles string-valued
	option, and has no arbitrary limits.
	(switches): Set `toenv' flag for -I and -v.

	* main.c (decode_env_switches): Cast return value of alloca to char *.

	* misc.c (child_access) [HAVE_SETREUID, HAVE_SETREGID]: Use
	setre[gu]id in place of set[gu]id.

Wed Jan  6 15:06:12 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* main.c (main): Define MAKEOVERRIDES, MAKE, and MAKE_COMMAND with
	origin o_default.

	* make.h [POSIX]: Don't test this to use ANSI_STRING.

	conditional directives.

	* main.c (main): Declare init_dir.

	* function.c (expand_function, patsubst_expand): Add parens around
	assignments inside `while' stmts.

	and pass them to decode_switches.
	(switches): Set `env' flag for -I and -v.

	* dir.c (init_dir): Cast free to __glob_closedir_hook's type.

Tue Jan  5 14:52:15 1993  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.62.25.

	* job.c [HAVE_SYS_WAIT || !USG]: Don't #include <sys/time.h> and
	<sys/resource.h>.  <sys/time.h> interacts badly with <time.h>, and
	we don't need these anyway.

	* configure.in (AC_HAVE_FUNCS): Check for setre[gu]id.
	* misc.c ({user,make}_access): Test #ifndef HAVE_SETRE[GU]ID, not
	#ifdef POSIX || USG.  SunOS 4.1 is supposedly POSIX.1 compliant,
	but its set[gu]id functions aren't; its setre[gu]id functions work.

	* misc.c ({user,make,child}_access): Give name of caller in error msgs.

	* job.c (load_too_high): Say "cannot enforce load limit" in error msg.

	* configure.in: Call AC_PROG_CC.

	* configure.in: Added fcntl.h to AC_HAVE_HEADERS.  getloadavg cares.

	* vpath.c (construct_vpath_list): Initialize P to DIRPATH before

	* remake.c (files_remade): Made global.
	(notice_finished_file): Don't increment files_remade here; this

	fact done.
	* job.c (reap_children): Do it here instead, when we know that
	actual commands have been run for the file.
	* make.h (files_remade): Declare it.

Sun Oct 25 01:48:23 1992  Roland McGrath  (roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* remake.c (update_file): Don't process F->also_make here.

	the target partially made.

Tue May 12 00:39:19 1992  Roland McGrath  (roland@albert.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* job.c (construct_command_argv_internal): After loop, if we only
	have one word, check it for being a shell command.

	* main.c (decode_switches): Allocate ARGC slots in other_args to
	begin with, so we never need to worry about growing it.
	If we get a non-option arg and POSIXLY_CORRECT is in the
	environment, break out of the loop.  After the loop, add all remaining
	args to other_args list.

	* main.c (decode_switches): For positive_int and floating switches
	when optarg is nil, use next arg if it looks right (start with a
	digit, or maybe decimal point for floating).

	default if it comes from the environment.  Set its export bit.
	* make.texinfo (Environment): Document change.

	(ETAGS, CTAGS): Define.

	* main.c (decode_switches): If a switches elt has a nil long_name,
	make the long option name elt be "".
	Fixed loop to not ignore all the options.

	* make.texinfo (Option Summary): Added long options.

	* main.c (switches): Changed -m's description to "-b".

	--makefile == -f.

	* main.c (switches): Removed bogus "silent" elt.
	(long_option_aliases): Define new var.
	(decode_switches): Add long_option_aliases onto the end of the long
	options vector created for getopt_long.
	Look through long_option_aliases for extra names to list
	in usage message.

	(objs, srcs): Include them.

	* job.c (child_died): Renamed to dead_children; made static.
	(child_handler): Increment dead_children instead of setting child_died.
	(reap_children): Decrement dead_children instead of clearing
	child_died.  The point of all this is to avoid printing "waiting
	for unfinished jobs" when we don't actually need to block.
	This happened when multiple SIGCHLDs before reap_children was called.

	* job.c (reap_children): If ERR is set, so we don't call start_job
	on the child being reaped, instead set its command_state to
	cs_finished.
	(reap_children, child_handler, new_job): I added several
	debugging printf's while fixing this.  I left them in if (debug_flag)
	because they may be useful for debugging this stuff again.

Wed May  6 22:02:37 1992  Roland McGrath  (roland@albert.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	args, set or clear export_all_variables, respectively.

	* variable.c (target_environment): Exclude MAKELEVEL in the loop,
	so it isn't duplicated when we add it at the end.

	have been exported under .NOEXPORT, and variables whose `export'
	member is v_export.

	* variable.h (try_variable_definition): Changed decl.
	* read.c (read_makefile): Recognize `export' and `unexport' directives.

	* remake.c (update_file, update_file_1): Do check_renamed on elts
	of dep chains when traversing them.  Something unrelated might have
	renamed one of the files the dep chain points to.

	* file.c (rename_file): If FILE has been renamed, follow its

	behavior.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Only use .DEFAULT cmds if FILE is not a

	* default.c (default_variables) [ultrix]: GET=get, like USG.
