2009-09-27  eliz <eliz>

	* ChangeLog, Makefile.DOS.template, configh.dos.template: 	* configh.dos.template: Remove unconditional definition of
		SYS_SIGLIST_DECLARED. 	Include <sys/version.h> because ports of GCC
		4.3.0 and later no 	longer include it, so macros like
		__DJGPP_MINOR__ are no longer 	defined automatically.  	*
		Makefile.DOS.template (INCLUDES): Use $(prefix) and the
		corresponding variables to define LIBDIR, INCLUDEDIR and LOCALEDIR
		instead of using the hardcoded ones. 	(SUBDIRS): doc subdir added.
		(INFO_DEPS, DVIS): Values changed to 'make.info' and 'make.dvi'.
		(TEXI2HTML, TEXI2HTML_FLAGS): Removed.  Use makeinfo --html to
		create html formated docs.  texi2html may not be ported to DOS.
		(make.info, make.dvi, make.ps, make.html): Make targets depend on
		'make.texi'. 	(.texi.info, .texi, .texi.dvi): Now recursively
		invocate.  Change 	-I switch to look in ./ instead of ./doc.
		(html): Target depend on html-recursive instead of make_1.html.
		(make_1.html): Removed. 	(mostlyclean-aminfo): Use $(srcdir)/doc
		instead of ./ as prefix. 	(all-recursive): Allow for more than one
		subdir in the build 	process. 	(mostlyclean-recursive,
		clean-recursive, distclean-recursive) 	(maintainer-clean-recursive,
		check-recursive): Enter in doc/ too. 	(tags-recursive): Allow for
		more than one subdir in the build 	process. 	(info-recursive,
		dvi-recursive, ps-recursive, html-recursive): New 	targets.  Enter
		into doc/ to produce the targets. 	(all-am): $(INFO_DEPS) replaced
		by info.

	tests/scripts/features/patternrules,
	tests/scripts/features/se_explicit,
	tests/scripts/features/se_implicit,
	tests/scripts/features/se_statpat: - Rework secondary expansion so we only defer it if there's a
	possibility   it might be needed: for most situations we parse
	prereqs immediately as   we used to.  Reduces memory usage. - Fixes
	Savannah bug #18622.

2009-09-16  psmith <psmith>

	* po/ChangeLog, po/LINGUAS: Added Italian (it) language support.

	rule.c, tests/run_make_tests.pl, variable.c, vmsfunctions.c: - Add xcalloc() and call it - Fix memory errors found by valgrind -
	Remove multi_glob() and empower parse_file_seq() to do its job:
	the goal here is to remove the confusing reverse/re-reverse we do on
	the file lists: needed for future fixes. - Add a prefix arg to
	parse_file_seq() - Make concat() variadic so it can take arbitrary
	#'s of strings

	etc.

	tests/scripts/targets/SECONDARY: Incorporate Icarus Sparry's fix for
	3330 and 15919, and test cases.  One of our translations disappeared

	make.texi.

2007-07-16  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* tests/run_make_tests.pl, tests/scripts/features/parallelism,

	tests/test_driver.pl: Fix Savannah bug #20452.  Add a new feature to

	Fix some documentation gitches. Fix an uninitialized variable. Add
	builtin rules for Objective C. Add a new debug line that shows where
	the commands that are about to be run were defined.

2007-05-09  psmith <psmith>

	* ChangeLog, acinclude.m4, config.ami.template,
	config.h-vms.template, config.h.W32.template, configh.dos.template,
	configure.in, function.c, hash.h, job.c, main.c, make.h, misc.c,
	vmsfunctions.c: Fix Savannah bug #19656: rationalize our use of
	case-insensitive string comparison functions to always use POSIX
	strcasecmp().  For non-POSIX systems that use other functions
	(strcmpi or stricmp) use a macro to alias strcasecmp to those.  If
	we can't find any of them (VMS, plus whatever UNIX doesn't have
	them) then define our own version in misc.c.

2007-03-21  psmith <psmith>

	* ChangeLog, configure.in: Fix Savannah bug #19348: if the user
	specified --disable-case-insensitive-file-system, don't turn it on.


2007-03-20  psmith <psmith>

	* ChangeLog, ar.c, commands.c, default.c, dep.h, dir.c, expand.c,
	file.c, filedef.h, function.c, implicit.c, job.c, main.c,
	maintMakefile, make.h, misc.c, read.c, remake.c, rule.c, rule.h,
	strcache.c, tests/run_make_tests.pl,
	tests/scripts/features/patternrules, tests/test_driver.pl,
	variable.c, variable.h, vpath.c: This is a major update, which
	switches virtually every allocated-but-not-freed string into the
	strcache.  As a side-effect, many more structure members and
	function arguments can/should be declared const.  As mentioned in
	the changelog, unfortunately measurement shows that this change does
	not yet reduce memory.  The problem is with secondary expansion:
	because of this we store all the prerequisites in the string cache
	twice. First we store the prerequisite string after initial
	expansion but before secondary expansion, then we store each
	individual file after secondary expansion and expand_deps().  I plan
	to change expand_deps() to be callable in either context (eval or
	snap_deps) then have non-second-expansion targets call expand_deps()
	during eval, so that we only need to store that dependency list
	once.

	* configure.ac, doc/mdb.texi, src/dbg_cmd.c, src/trace.h: 
	configure.ac: now in 0.63cvs - we can't really fake it any more.
	src/dbg_cmd.c: Add a "list" command. Basically same as "target x
	depends commands" for now. "list -" shows the parent target.  Help
	commands now show short usage.  src/trace.h: Allow us to fathom
	debugger command errors that stay in the read command loop  Go over
	documentation to add new features and fix up some old mistakes.

	First part of const-ification done to track recent GNU Make changes
	of Nov 18, '06

2006-11-18  psmith <psmith>

	* .cvsignore, ChangeLog, ar.c, arscan.c, commands.c, commands.h,
	default.c, dep.h, dir.c, expand.c, file.c, function.c, job.c,
	main.c, make.h, read.c, remake.c, strcache.c, variable.c,
	variable.h, vmsdir.h, vmsify.c, vpath.c, w32/include/pathstuff.h,
	w32/pathstuff.c: Fix from Eli for incorrect value of $(MAKE) on
	Cygwin.  A few changes from char* to void* where appropriate, and
	removing of unnecessary casts.  Much more work on const-ifying the
	codebase.  This round involves some code changes to make it correct.
	NOTE!!  There will almost certainly be problems on the non-POSIX
	ports that will need to be addressed after the const changes are
	finished: they will need to be const-ified properly and there may
	need to be some changes to allocate memory, etc. as well.  The next
	(last?) big push for this, still to come, is const-ifying the
	filenames in struct file, struct dep, etc.  This will allow us to
	store file names in the string cache and finally resolve Savannah
	bug #15182 (make uses too much memory), among other advantages.

2006-10-01  psmith <psmith>

	patch from Eli to allow Cygwin builds to support DOS-style
	pathnames.

2006-07-29  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* configure.ac: Patch from Dave Korn:  Final link fails when srcdir
	!= objdir because it looks in the source tree for libglob.a rather
	than the build tree. The following patch (followed by regenerating
	the auto-* files) fixed it for me. HTH!

	canonical FSF copyright features and statement. Some $(realpath ...)
	tests won't work on Windows; leave them out The jobserver
	filedescriptor test might fail if some FDs are reserved, so for now
	comment out that check.

2006-03-29  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* doc/mdb.texi: Go over intro a little. What I thought was a bug in
	remake in fact is just the arcane way GNU make works. (I mean it
	makes sense but boy do you have to do some digging in the GNU Make
	manual to find out what's going on.)

	the program that creates a DBM file.

2005-12-21  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* src/job.c: Was erroneously showing command delimiters on the
	"echo" command.

2005-12-20  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* src/debug.h: Doc change.

2005-12-20  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* NEWS, src/dbg_cmd.c, src/dbg_fns.c, src/dbg_fns.h, src/debug.c,
	src/debug.h, src/function.c, src/job.c, src/main.c, src/read.c,
	src/remake.c, src/trace.c: More debug tracing funnelled through
	db_level. Debugger command "show debug" shows the debug mask in a
	more understandable way.

2005-12-20  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* src/job.c, src/main.c: job.c: separator bars should be
	before/after commands even when entering the debugger or stepping.
	main.c: enter debugger on next/step on successful termination.

2005-12-20  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* src/debug.h, src/job.c, src/main.c, tests/scripts/debugger/trace: 
	Now shows shell tracing when --trace=normal or stepping debugging.
	YEAH!

2005-12-20  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* AUTHORS, NEWS, README.Amiga, doc/make.texi, src/debug.h,

	in some of the relevant changes from 3.81 AUTHORS, NEWS: revise for
	this project

2005-12-20  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* README.cvs: Revise for this project.

	* README.Amiga: What the story is for Amiga.

2005-12-19  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* src/dir_fns.c: Remove the more specific free() for now. Crashes on
	64-bit athlon systems.

2005-12-19  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* src/debug.h, src/main.c, src/read.c, src/read.h, src/types.h,
	tests/scripts/options/dash-l: Remove this horrible hack where
	stringlist_t's were cast to char ** and issues of memory allocation
	blithly ignored.  Fixes a problem with dash-I on cygwin? Definitely
	reduces valgrind memory leaks.  dash-l: reinstated - I feel lucky?

2005-12-19  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	slightly different. Remove variable tracing - Is now folded into
	db_level. Change a couple of "int"s to "bool"s

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* tests/scripts/debugger/trace, tests/scripts/features/echoing,
	tests/scripts/options/dash-n: Output has changed. Reflect that in
	tests.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* doc/makedb.texi: Describe --just-print and --debug=basic to show
	how we differ from that.  Note set variable SHELL $(SHELL -x) trick
	to get tracing from the shell.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* src/job.c: tracing is a little more like --just-print

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* NEWS, src/job.c: Give line numbers and target names on
	--just-print.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* doc/makedb.texi, src/dbg_cmd.c, src/dbg_fns.c: Work on doc to
	bring it in line (a little) with recent work. No longer show target
	after file location. We have that expanded below with the
	dependencies.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	documentation

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* src/default.c, src/remake.c, src/rule.c: Some nexting tweaks and a
	free here and there.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* po/Makefile.in.in: Need this because mkinstalldirs isn't in config
	under this directory.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* po/Makefile.in.in: Update to gettext-0.14.4 and add .PHONY for
	some phony tags.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* src/commands.c, src/commands.h: Turn some #defines and a char
	field into an enum.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* NEWS, src/default.c, src/dir_fns.c, src/file.c, src/hash.c,
	src/implicit.c, src/main.c, src/make.h, src/read.c, src/remake.c,
	src/rule.c, tests/scripts/options/dash-l, tests/test_driver.pl: Go
	over memory allocation more. Reduce shared pointers. Free memory at
	the end explicitly so can use valgrind more agressively in the
	future.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* src/dbg_cmd.c, src/dbg_fns.c, src/dbg_fns.h, src/dbg_stack.c: Move
	code to show target and prerequisites to on debugger prompt out of
	command routine and into fns. Is now show on stack motion commands.


2005-12-18  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* src/main.c: Wrong &.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* po/POTFILES.in: We don't have getopt.c any more.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* ChangeLog, configure.ac, src/main.c, src/print.c, src/print.h,
	tests/scripts/features/escape, tests/scripts/features/mult_rules,

	tests/scripts/options/dash-k, tests/scripts/options/dash-q,
	tests/scripts/options/general, tests/scripts/variables/flavors: 
	Debugger error output changed. Get test results to match up.  Note:
	print.c needs to be changed to be able to deal with stderr as well
	as or in addition to stdout.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* src/dbg_cmd.c: Show target and dependencies in entering debugger.
	Could/should generalize as part of a prompt string.

2005-12-17  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* tests/run_make_tests.pl, tests/scripts/debugger/trace,
	tests/scripts/features/errors, tests/scripts/features/vpathplus,

	src/print.c, src/variable.c: More explicit frees of memory.
	free_hash_table gives a callback for a routine to free an item.
	--extended-errors is now the default. Use --no-extended-errors if
	you don't want that.  Use installed getopt.{c,h} - that's probably
	better maintained.

2005-12-17  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* ChangeLog, src/default.c, src/dir_fns.c, src/hash.c, src/job.c,
	src/main.c, src/make.h, src/print.c, src/rule.c: Yet another attempt
	to reduce unexplicitly free'd memory.  The next big win will

	tests/scripts/functions/wildcard: Work on getting quit to quit
	better - previously it could cause an infinite loop.  Add some of
	the smaller fixes from make 3.81 which improve regression tests or
	initialize variables where they hadn't been before.

	Valgrind was showing uninitialized accesses. We now use calloc more
	pervasively and we no longer cast nameseq's to dep's but do a proper

	* src/alloca.c, src/dbg_cmd.c, src/function.c, src/function.h,

	tests/scripts/variables/automatic: Make second expansion optional
	(partial implementation).  I decided this feature was too impacting
	to make the permanent default behavior.  This set of changes makes
	the default behavior of make the old behavior (no second expansion).
	If you want second expansion, you must define the .SECONDEXPANSION:
	special target before the first target that needs it.  This set of
	changes ONLY fixes explicit and static pattern rules to work like
	this.  Implicit rules still have second expansion enabled all the
	time: I'll work on that next.  Note that there is still a
	backward-incompatibility: now to get the old SysV behavior using $$@
	etc. in the prerequisites list you need to set .SECONDEXPANSION: as
	well.

2005-09-28  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

2005-08-31  psmith <psmith>

	If we're on a DOS/W32/OS2 system and we're not using a unixy shell,
	don't follow POSIX backslash/newline conventions.  Use a different
	method for testing the SHELL variable, which hopefully will work
	better on non-UNIX systems.

2005-08-13  bosk <bosk>

	1328: if stdout is redirected to a full filesystem, we check for
	this and exit with an error. The closeout.c version from gnulib
	pulls in too much other stuff, and gnulib requires an ANSI C 89
	compliant compiler, while GNU make (so far) still wants to work on

	* ChangeLog, doc/make.texi, job.c, main.c, remake.c: Document the
	secondary expansion method.  Also, some other documentation
	cleanups.  If we find a make error (invalid makefile syntax or
	something like that) write back any tokens we have before we exit.
	If we have waiting jobs (using -j + -l) set an alarm before we sleep
	on the read() system call, so we can wake up to check the load and
	start waiting jobs, if there are long-running jobs we would
	otherwise be waiting for.  Suggested by Grant Taylor.

2005-05-03  psmith <psmith>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS, doc/make.texi, filedef.h, job.c, job.h, main.c,
	read.c, tests/ChangeLog, tests/scripts/features/parallelism,
	tests/scripts/variables/DEFAULT_GOAL,
	tests/scripts/variables/DEFAULT_TARGET, vmsfunctions.c, vmsjobs.c: 
	Fix problems with losing tokens in the jobserver, reported by Grant
	Taylor.  There are two forms of this: first, it was possible to lose
	tokens when using -j and -l at the same time, because waiting jobs
	were not checked when determining whether any jobs were outstanding.
	Second, if you had an exported recursive variable that contained a
	$(shell ...) function there is a possibility to lose tokens, since a
	token was taken but the child list was not updated until after the
	shell function was complete.  To resolve this I introduced a new
	variable that counted the number of tokens we have obtained, rather
	than checking whether there were any children on the list.  I also
	added some sanity checks to make sure we weren't writing back too
	many or not enough tokens.  And, the master make will drain the
	token pipe before exiting and compare the count of tokens at the end
	to what was written there at the beginning.  Also:   * Ensure a bug
	in the environment (missing "=") doesn't cause make to core.   *
	Rename the .DEFAULT_TARGET variable to .DEFAULT_GOAL, to match the
	terminology in the documentation and other variables like
	MAKECMDGOALS.   * Add documentation of the .DEFAULT_GOAL special
	variable.  Still need to document the secondary expansion stuff...

2005-04-26  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* src/misc.c: From Rich Paul:  Sometimes routines allocate objects
	of type dep_t using xmalloc, and not initializing all of the
	members:  the specific issue noticed was that the ignore_mtime
	field, which marks a target as an 'order only' target is not always
	initialized.  You can recognize that this is happening by doing a
	make -p, and look for target lines like:  >> tgt:  dep1 | dep2  The
	dependency dep1 and it's ilk are normal deps, but changes to dep2
	and friends will not (if I understand order only targets properly)
	cause tgt to be rebuilt ... their only contribution is that if, for
	some reason, dep2 and tgt are rebuilt, the dep2 target will be
	completed before tgt is started.  The problem is NOT limited to
	dep_t structures: if rather than initializing all malloc'd memory to
	0, I initialize it to 0xff, the resulting make cannot even parse
	it's own src/Makefile: it fails with a 'missing separator' message
	... this appears to be a separate bug in read.c, which has, as of
	yet, eluded me.

	* NEWS, config/readline.h, config/readline.m4, configure.ac,

2005-04-13  psmith <psmith>

	* ChangeLog, dep.h, file.c, implicit.c, main.c, read.c, rule.c: Fix
	performance degradation introduced by the second expansion feature.
	I did this by adding intelligence into the algorithm such that the
	second expansion was only actually performed when the prerequisite
	list contained at least one "$", so we knew it is actually needed.
	Without this we were using up a LOT more memory, since every single
	target (even ones never used by make) had their file variables
	initialized.  This also used a lot more CPU, since we needed to
	create and populate a new variable hash table for every target.
	There is one issue remaining with this feature: it leaks memory.  In
	pattern_search() we now initialize the file variables for every
	pattern target, which allocates a hash table, etc.  However,
	sometimes we recursively invoke pattern_search() (for intermediate
	files) with an automatic variable (alloca() I believe) as the file.
	When that function returns, obviously, the file variable hash memory
	is lost.

	tests/scripts/functions/realpath: Implemented `realpath' and
	`abspath' built-in functions.

2004-11-29  psmith <psmith>

	* ChangeLog, main.c, tests/ChangeLog, tests/scripts/options/dash-C,
	tests/scripts/variables/flavors: Fix bug #10252: Remove any trailing
	slashes from -C arguments (WINDOWS32).  Add a regression test for
	"@" before a define/enddef vs. one inside.

2004-11-28  psmith <psmith>

	* ChangeLog, doc/make.texi, main.c, make.h, tests/ChangeLog,
	tests/scripts/variables/MAKELEVEL, tests/scripts/variables/SHELL,
	variable.c: Fix for bug #1276: Handle SHELL according to POSIX
	requirements.  POSIX requires that the value of SHELL in the
	makefile NOT be exported to sub-commands.  Instead, the value in the
	environment when make was invoked should be passed to the
	environment of sub-commands.  Note that make still uses SHELL to
	_run_ sub-commands; it just doesn't change the value of the SHELL
	variable in the environment of sub-commands.  As an extension to
	POSIX, if the makefile explicitly exports SHELL then GNU make _will_
	use it in the environment of sub-commands.

2004-09-21  psmith <psmith>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS, read.c, tests/scripts/functions/eval: Some code
	cleanups and efficiency enhancements.  As far as I can tell none of
	these have impacts that are visible to the user (although in some
	cases that appears to be nothing more than dumb luck :-/).

2004-09-21  psmith <psmith>

	* ChangeLog, commands.c, function.c, main.c, make.h, misc.c,
	tests/ChangeLog: Remove sindex() and replace with strstr(). Windows:
	allow users to set SHELL to cmd.exe and have it behave as if no UNIX
	shell were found.

2004-09-21  psmith <psmith>

	* tests/run_make_tests.pl, tests/scripts/variables/flavors,
	tests/test_driver.pl: Add some more unit tests for variable flavors.
	Allow run_make_tests() to be invoked with an undef makefile string,
	in which case it re-uses the previous string.

2004-09-21  psmith <psmith>

	* ChangeLog, expand.c, function.c, job.c, read.c, tests/ChangeLog,
	tests/run_make_tests.pl, tests/scripts/functions/substitution,
	variable.h: Fix some bugs in variable pattern substitution (e.g.
	$(VAR:A=B)), reported by Markus Mauhart <qwe123@chello.at>.  One was
	a simple typo; to fix the other we call patsubst_expand() for all
	instances of variable substitution, even when there is no '%'.  We
	used to call subst_expand() with a special flag set in the latter
	case, but it didn't work properly in all situations.  Easier to just
	use patsubst_expand() since that's what it is.

2004-06-24  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* src/dbg_cmd.c: Add ability to print specified attributes of a

	those to derive the target location.

2004-06-24  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* src/print.c: When printing location, If the target is an absolute
	filename, don't prepend starting-directory.  starting-directory is
	only needed if a relative filename.  When printing target. If we
	don't have location info for the target but do have location info
	for the commands it runs, use that to derive a target location.
	(Right now we assume the target is the line before the line that the
	commands start.)

	MINGW32 systems.  Only missing from this commit are the changes to
	configure.in etc.; I'm waiting for Earnie to sign papers for those
	new files.  Also not here is any README.mingw32 etc. which would
	explain how to use this port.

2003-10-22  psmith <psmith>

	* ChangeLog, file.c, tests/ChangeLog,
	tests/scripts/targets/SECONDARY: Fix bug #2515: the .SECONDARY

	vpath.c: Portability fix for glob.h building in FreeBSD ports
	system.  Implement a fix for bug # 2169: too many OSs, even major
	OSs like Solaris, don't properly implement SA_RESTART: important
	system calls like stat() can still fail when SA_RESTART is set.  So,
	forget the BROKEN_RESTART config check and get rid of atomic_stat()
	and atomic_readdir(), and implement permanent wrappers for EINTR
	checking on various system calls (stat(), fstat(), opendir(), and
	readdir() so far).

2003-01-22  psmith <psmith>

	remote-cstms.c, remote-stub.c, rule.c, signame.c, variable.c,
	vmsfunctions.c, vmsify.c, vpath.c: Convert the source code to use
	ANSI C style function definitions and enable the automake ansi2knr
	capability.  Right now this doesn't quite build using a K&R compiler
	because of a problem with the loadavg test program, but the rest of
	the code works.  I'm asking the automake list about this problem.

	that section.

2002-10-05  psmith <psmith>

	* ChangeLog, expand.c, po/ChangeLog, po/POTFILES.in, read.c,
	tests/ChangeLog, tests/scripts/variables/automatic: Fix core dump on
	malformed variable line (Debian bug #81656) Allow SysV-style
	variable references to use {} in addition to (). Add variable.h to
	the POTFILES.in since it has a translatable string.

2002-10-04  psmith <psmith>

	* NEWS: Update version info.

2002-10-04  psmith <psmith>

	* Makefile.am: Don't put .cvsignore files in the distributed tar

	* ChangeLog, doc/make.texi, read.c, tests/ChangeLog,
	tests/scripts/features/export: Fix a bug exporting/unexporting
	multiple variables in one command. Update the text about reporting
	bugs.

2002-09-18  psmith <psmith>

	* ChangeLog, doc/make.texi, function.c, hash.c, signame.c: Add some
	indexing to the manual. Fix a few simple casting warnings, etc.

2002-09-17  psmith <psmith>

	* ChangeLog, read.c, tests/ChangeLog,
	tests/scripts/features/targetvars, variable.c: Fix bug #940 (from
	the Savannah bug tracker): make sure that target- specific variables
	work correctly in conjunction with double-colon targets.

2002-09-12  psmith <psmith>

	* ChangeLog, Makefile.am, commands.c, misc.c: Fixups for the
	release.  One bug fix, some automake complaint fixes, and a function

	(only noticed when using Windows). Update .cvsignore files.

2002-09-10  psmith <psmith>

	* tests/test_driver.pl: Fix regex matching for modification time
	warnings. The ones we had were weird, and failed for multiple
	warnings in a single file.

2002-09-10  psmith <psmith>

	* tests/scripts/features/conditionals,
	tests/scripts/features/export, tests/scripts/options/dash-B,
	tests/scripts/variables/automatic: A few test bug fixes:   * Never
	use "touch" in make rules; it breaks on most sub-second
	supporting systems.  Use echo "" > $@ instead.   * Forgot to close
	test makefiles before using them!  All the above worked fine on
	Linux but failed miserably on Solaris.

2002-09-10  psmith <psmith>

	* NEWS, tests/ChangeLog, tests/test_driver.pl: Have the test driver
	check for the new format of the time skew error messages.

2002-09-10  psmith <psmith>

	* ChangeLog, configure.in, doc/make.texi, make.h, misc.c, read.c,

	gettext. Invent a new macro HAVE_DOS_PATHS and change various
	instances of:   #if defined(WINDOWS) || defined(__MSDOS__) to use
	the new macro instead.  This should help make the OS/2 port cleaner,
	as well. Invent a cvs-clean maintainer target that tries to get the
	workspace back to the state it was in after a CVS checkout. New
	language.

2002-08-08  psmith <psmith>

	Wed May 15 10:14:14 CDT 1996  Rob Tulloh  <tulloh@tivoli.com>  	*
	dir.c: WIN32 does not support inode. For now, fully qualified
	pathname along with st_mtime will be keys for files. 	Fixed problem
	where vpath can be confused when files 	are added to a directory
	after the directory has already been 	read in. The code now attempts
	to reread the directory if it 	discovers that the datestamp on the
	directory has changed since 	it was cached by make. This problem
	only seems to occur on WIN32 	right now so it is lumped under port
	#ifdef WIN32.  	* function.c: WIN32: call subproc library
	(CreateProcess()) instead of 	fork/exec.  	* job.c: WIN32: Added the
	code to do fork/exec/waitpid style processing 	on WIN32 systems via
	calls to subproc library.  	* main.c: WIN32: Several things added
	here. First, there is code 	for dealing with PATH and SHELL
	defaults. Make tries to figure 	out if the user has %PATH% set in
	the environment and sets it to 	%Path% if it is not set already.
	Make also looks to see if sh.exe 	is anywhere to be found. Code path
	through job.c will change 	based on existence of a working Bourne
	shell. The checking for 	default shell is done twice: once before
	makefiles are read in 	and again after. Fall back to MSDOS style
	execution mode if no sh.exe 	is found. Also added some debug support
	that allows user to pause make 	with -D switch and attach a
	debugger. This is especially useful for 	debugging recursive calls
	to make where problems appear only in the 	sub-make.  	* make.h:
	WIN32: A few macros and header files for WIN32 support.  	* misc.c:
	WIN32: Added a function end_of_token_w32() to assist 	in parsing
	code in read.c.  	* read.c: WIN32: Fixes similar to MSDOS which
	allow colon to 	appear in filenames. Use of colon in filenames would
	otherwise 	confuse make.  	* remake.c: WIN32: Added include of io.h
	to eliminate compiler 	warnings. Added some code to default LIBDIR
	if it is not set 	on WIN32.  	* variable.c: WIN32: Added support for
	detecting Path/PATH 	and converting them to semicolon separated
	lists for make's 	internal use. New function sync_Path_environment()
	which is called in job.c and function.c before creating a new
	process. Caller must set Path in environment since we don't 	have
	fork() to do this for us.  	* vpath.c: WIN32: Added detection for
	filenames containing 	forward or backward slashes.  	* NMakefile:
	WIN32: Visual C compatible makefile for use with nmake. 	Use this to
	build GNU make the first time on Windows NT or Windows 95.  	*
	README.WIN32: WIN32: Contains some helpful notes.  	* build_w32.bat:
	WIN32: If you don't like nmake, use this the first 	time you build
	GNU make on Windows NT or Windows 95.  	* config.h.WIN32: WIN32
	version of config.h  	* subproc.bat: WIN32: A bat file used to build
	the 	subproc library from the top-level NMakefile. Needed because
	WIndows 95 (nmake) doesn't allow you to cd in a make rule.  	*
	w32/include/dirent.h 	* w32/compat/dirent.c: WIN32: opendir,

	read.c, remake.c 	* commands.c: Amiga has neither SIGHUP nor SIGQUIT
	* dir.c: Amiga has filenames with Upper- and Lowercase, 	but
	"FileName" is the same as "filename". Added strieq() 	which is use
	to compare filenames. This is like streq() 	on all other systems.
	Also there is no such thing as 	"." under AmigaDOS. 	* function.c:
	On Amiga, the environment is not passed as envp, 	there are no pipes
	and Amiga can't fork. Use my own function 	to create a new child. 	*
	job.c: default_shell is "" (The system automatically chooses 	a
	shell for me). Have to use the same workaround as MSDOS for 	running
	batch commands. Added HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H. NOFILE isn't 	known on
	Amiga. Cloned code to run children from MSDOS. Own 	version of
	sh_chars[] and sh_cmds[]. No dup2() or dup() on Amiga. 	* main.c:
	Force stack to 20000 bytes. Read environment from ENV: 	device. On
	Amiga, exec_command() does return, so I exit() 	afterwards. 	*
	make.h: Added strieq() to compare filenames. 	* read.c: Amiga needs
	special extension to have passwd. Only 	one include-dir. "Makefile"
	and "makefile" are the same. 	Added "SMakefile".  Added special code

	on macros that are   defined when the commands are executed (such as
	`$@'). * Added `-w' switch to log directories to stdout. * Added
	selective VPATH lists and the `vpath' directive. * Added the
	previously undocumented `-lLIB' dependent syntax. * Added the

	variable   assignments and changed most examples to use `:=' rather
	than `='. * Corrected miscellaneous typos, grammatical errors, etc.
	This version of the documentation is accurate for revision 1.2 of
	the source.
